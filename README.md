# AdvancedR3:

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is used in the Advanced DDEA Course on Reproducible
Research in R. A metabolomics dataset will be used for demonstrative
purposes.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Lipidomics (dataset)
-   `doc/`: Learning.qmd (here we write some code, alter it, making
    final functions)
-   `R/`: functions.R (store the final functions that we develop in
    learning.qmd)

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
